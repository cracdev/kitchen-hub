# KitchenHub

A web application built with React, and Redux to interface with my personal API server, `https://open.zigmundsunoo.com/`.
This application store recipes that I may find useful when I cook.
Built as a web application for a Raspberry Pi 7" touch screen device. Used in my kitchen. This code piggybacks off of `create-react-app` for startup.
