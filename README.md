# KitchenHub

A web application built with React, and Redux to interface with my personal API server, `https://open.zigmundsunoo.com/`.
This application stores links of recipes that I find useful when I cook online. 
Built as a web application purposefully built for a Raspberry Pi with a 7" touch screen device and was to be used in my kitchen. This application has evolved over time to not only exist with my Raspberry Pi device, but also on desktop browsers, as well as on mobile as a progressive web application.
